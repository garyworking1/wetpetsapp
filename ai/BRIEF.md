# WetPets — Project Brief

**Mission:** Help Austin dog owners find safe, dog-friendly water (creeks, lakes, splash pads, safe access points), with safety notes and community submissions.

**Audience:** Austin/TX dog people (starting in Austin; expand later).

**Value props:**
- Curated, safety-minded water spots for dogs
- Community-contributed details (“Add a Spot”)
- Simple, fast mobile-first UI
- Clear directions & “what to watch for” safety notes

**Success criteria (MVP web):**
- Homepage with hero, featured spots, “Add a Spot”
- Detail pages at `/spots/[slug]` for each spot
- “Add a Spot” works via embedded Google Form
- Plausible pageview & outbound tracking firing
- Lighthouse perf/SEO/accessibility ≥ 90 (mobile)

**Non-goals (for now):**
- Accounts, real-time moderation, native app, ML
